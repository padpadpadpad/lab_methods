### Ingredients


|To add|Grams/L|
|-|-|
|glycerol|10.0 g|
|peptone|20.0 g|
|$K_{2}HPO_{4}$|1.5g|
|30% sterile $MgSO_{4}.7H_{2}O$ solution|5 mL|
|Agar|0 g (media), 12 g (hard agar), 3.5 g (soft agar)|

- Final pH should be 7.2 +/- 0.2 (@ 25 ÂºC)

### Method

- Take a 1 L duran bottle and put put in the glycerol, peptone and potassium hydrogen phosphate. Each ingredient should be weighed out on the scales using a weighing boat
- For KB media, add no agar. For soft agar, add around 3.5 g of agar and for hard agar, add 12 g of agar to the duran bottle
- Add 500 mL of distilled water and dissolve the ingredients using the magnetic heat plate after putting a magenetic stirrer into the bottle
- Add the remaining 500 mL of distilled water and continue to stir the media
- When dissolved, take out the magnetic stirrer
- Label the duran and autoclave
- Prior to use, add the 5 mL of 30% sterile $MgSO_{4}.7H_{2}O$ solution. This solution is made by adding 30 g of $MgSO_{4}.7H_{2}O$ to 100 mL of distilled water and autoclaving
- After mixing the magnesium sulphate solution into the KB agar, your media is ready to use and plates to be poured
